# Bikesharing
## Overview
New York City's Citibike program has become fairly well-known across the country. It's a convenient way for residents, and even tourists, to get around the city. Because of the success of the program, it is good to look at how people use Citibikes in New York City during August, one of the busiest months in the city when residents and tourists are using bikes to travel around the city. By looking at the breakdown of trips during this time, it can be used as model of how a program like this could work in a smaller city like Des Moines. For the trip analysis, we looked at the peak times of of trips by gender and overall users. 

## Results
A collection of the graphs can be found here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/madison.m.pooser/viz/CitibikeChallengeAnalysis_16231257837810/CitibikeAnalysis)

The above graph shows number of trips dring the hours of each day. It shows that the largest peak of the day is between 4-7pm. There is another large peak between 8-9am. These hours are typically the times of rush hour in many cities which leads to the conclusion that Citibikes are being used as part of people's daily commute.

When looking at the peak times closer by weekday, we see the 2 peak times shown in the first graph occur on weekdays. On weekends, we see that Saturdays have the most rides with the peak being from 9am-7pm.

The above graphs show that male and female trips follow the same trend of the peak times on the days that are present with the all users graph.

Unknown riders during the week do not follow the same trend as male and female riders. Unknown riders have their peaks during the weekend, specifically Saturdays between 9am-8pm.

Looking at male and female trip durations, male riders have longer trip durations more frequently than female riders during the two peak times. 

## Summary
From our analysis, we can determine that a bike ridership program in Des Moines would ostly be used by residents. The Citibike program has the most rides by subscribers for their bikes. These rides occured during commuting times meaning subscribers are most likely to use Citibikes for their everyday lives. In seeing the most popular days for customers and that it coincides withh the most popular for unkonwn riders, it can be determined that customer riders are most likely tourists and other one-off riders who may not be choosing their gender when checking out a bike. In looking to advertise a similar bike program towards Des Moines riders, it would be good to appeal towards residents as a way for them to change their daily commute. Other good visualizations to see would be a graph ofsubscribers to see how any continue their subscription month to month and to see how many bikesare availale throughout New York City to eep up with themand during the peak hours as well as other times during the day and the week.
